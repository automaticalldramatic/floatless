# Introduction

### Hello!

> Thank you for considering contributing to Floatless. We started this as a pet project and there is a lot of work to do to make this ready for use in a production system

> Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### What kind of contributions is Floatless looking for.

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you. You can -

* add documentation and “how-to” articles to the README or Wiki.

* help people with the questions they ask on StackOverflow.

* create examples that show you how to use Floatless better

* improve the existing example applications or reorganize code better


### When contributing to Floatless, we ask that you:

* let us know what you plan in the GitHub Issue tracker so we can provide feedback.

* provide tests and documentation whenever possible. It is very unlikely that we will accept new features without the proper testing and documentation. When fixing a bug, provide a failing test case that your patch solves.

* open a GitHub Pull Request with your patches and we will review your contribution and respond as quickly as possible. Keep in mind that this is an open source project, and it may take us some time to get back to you. Your patience is very much appreciated.

### What are we not looking for

Again, defining this up front means less work for you. If someone ignores your guide and submits something you don’t want, you can simply close it and point to your policy.

> Please, don't use the issue tracker for [support questions]. Stack Overflow is worth considering or you could write directly to us at mailme@rizwaniqbal.com.
