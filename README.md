# Floatless


### Grid Layout by Rizwan Iqbal

This a flex grid aimed to take advantage of solving common web-design problems with Flex. It was inspired by Philip Waltons [project](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/). The idea behind this grid was to come up with a better solution for placing boxes on the screen without `float` property of CSS (at the time of writing this, most popular grids were based on this).
